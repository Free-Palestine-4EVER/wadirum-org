3. **Combine activities**: Some camps offer package deals with accommodation and tours
4. **Bring your own snacks and extra water** from outside Wadi Rum
5. **Use public transportation** to reach Wadi Rum instead of taxis
6. **Book directly** with Bedouin camps rather than through international booking platforms
7. **Negotiate respectfully**: Some flexibility exists, especially in low season
8. **Get the Jordan Pass** if visiting other attractions in Jordan

## Payment Information

- **Cash is king**: Most camps and guides prefer Jordanian Dinars (JOD)
- **ATMs**: None in Wadi Rum; withdraw cash in Aqaba or Petra before arriving
- **Credit cards**: Some luxury camps accept cards, but always have cash as backup
- **Currency exchange**: Not available in Wadi Rum

## Conclusion

Wadi Rum offers experiences for every budget, from basic authentic Bedouin camps to luxury bubble tents with panoramic desert views. The key expenses are accommodation, transportation, and tours, with most other costs being relatively minimal.

For the best value, we recommend spending at least one night in the desert and choosing a camp that includes dinner and breakfast. A half-day or full-day jeep tour will allow you to see the major attractions, while adding a camel ride provides a more traditional desert experience.
