# How to Get a Wadi Rum Visa and What You Need to Know

Planning a trip to the magnificent Wadi Rum desert in Jordan requires some preparation, especially when it comes to visa requirements. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about obtaining a visa for your Wadi Rum adventure.

## Jordan Visa Types

Jordan offers several types of visas for tourists:

1. **Single-Entry Tourist Visa**: Valid for 30 days, this is the most common visa for tourists visiting Wadi Rum.
2. **Multiple-Entry Visa**: Valid for 90 days, ideal for those planning to exit and re-enter Jordan.
3. **Jordan Pass**: A package that includes your tourist visa and entry to over 40 attractions in Jordan, including Petra and Wadi Rum.

## Visa on Arrival vs. E-Visa

Most visitors can obtain a visa on arrival at Queen Alia International Airport in Amman or at the Aqaba border crossing. However, applying for an e-visa in advance can save you time at the border.

### Countries Eligible for Visa on Arrival

Citizens from most European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and many Asian and South American countries can obtain a visa on arrival.

### Visa Fees

- Single-entry visa: 40 JOD (approximately $56 USD)
- Multiple-entry visa: 60 JOD (approximately $85 USD)
- Jordan Pass: Starting from 70 JOD (approximately $99 USD)

## The Jordan Pass Advantage

For most tourists planning to visit Petra and other attractions, the Jordan Pass is highly recommended as it:

1. Waives your tourist visa fees (if staying a minimum of 3 nights)
2. Includes entry to Petra, Jerash, Wadi Rum, and many other sites
3. Saves you money compared to purchasing individual tickets

## Visa Application Process

### E-Visa Application

1. Visit the official Jordan e-visa portal
2. Create an account and fill out the application form
3. Upload required documents (passport copy, photo)
4. Pay the visa fee online
5. Wait for approval (usually 2-3 business days)

### Required Documents

- Valid passport with at least 6 months validity from your planned entry date
- Passport-sized photo
- Proof of accommodation in Jordan
- Return flight ticket
- Proof of sufficient funds for your stay

## Special Cases and Exceptions

- **Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ)**: Visitors entering Jordan through Aqaba (by air or land) can receive a free one-month visa, but must remain in the ASEZ.
- **Group Tours**: Some tour operators can arrange visas for group travelers.
- **Work or Study Visas**: Require additional documentation and approval.

## Tips for a Smooth Visa Process

1. Apply at least 2 weeks before your trip
2. Ensure your passport has enough blank pages
3. Have printed copies of your hotel reservations and return tickets
4. Carry some cash in Jordanian Dinars for visa fees if obtaining on arrival
5. Check the latest visa requirements before traveling, as regulations can change

## Extending Your Stay

If you wish to extend your stay in Jordan beyond your visa validity:

1. Visit the nearest police station or the Ministry of Interior in Amman
2. Submit an extension application with valid reasons
3. Pay the extension fee (approximately 40 JOD for 2 weeks)

## Conclusion

Obtaining a visa for Jordan to visit Wadi Rum is relatively straightforward for most travelers. The Jordan Pass offers excellent value for tourists planning to visit multiple attractions. Always check the latest requirements from official sources before your trip, as visa policies can change.
