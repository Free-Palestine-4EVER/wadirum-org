    # Jeep Tours and Overnight Stays in Wadi Rum

    Combining a Jeep tour with an overnight stay in Wadi Rum creates a complete desert experience. Here's what you need to know about these popular packages:

    ## Tour + Overnight Package Structure

    Most combined packages include:
    - Afternoon Jeep tour (3-4 hours) visiting major sites
    - Sunset viewing at a scenic location
    - Dinner at the camp (typically traditional Bedouin zarb)
    - Overnight accommodation
    - Breakfast
    - Optional sunrise viewing
    - Morning Jeep tour to additional sites (for 2-day packages)

    ## Accommodation Options

    1. **Traditional Bedouin Camps**: Simple tents with shared facilities
    2. **Comfort Camps**: Private tents with proper beds and shared bathrooms
    3. **Luxury Camps**: Private tents with en-suite bathrooms and quality furnishings
    4. **Bubble Tents**: Transparent domes for stargazing from your bed
    5. **Wild Camping**: Basic camping under the stars (for adventurous travelers)

    ## Evening Activities

    - Stargazing (Wadi Rum has minimal light pollution)
    - Bedouin music around the campfire
    - Traditional stories from local guides
    - Night photography opportunities

    ## Practical Considerations

    - Bring warm clothes even in summer (desert nights get cold)
    - Most camps provide bedding but bring a light sleeping bag for wild camping
    - Power banks for charging devices (limited electricity)
    - Flashlight/headlamp for navigating at night

    An overnight stay allows you to experience the desert's transformation from day to night and witness both sunset and sunrise over the dramatic landscape.
