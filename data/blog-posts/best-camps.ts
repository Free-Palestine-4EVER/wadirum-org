## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Camp

1. **Location** - Some camps are located deeper in the desert, offering more seclusion and better views
2. **Facilities** - Consider what amenities are important to you (private bathrooms, electricity, etc.)
3. **Meals** - The quality of food can vary significantly between camps
4. **Activities** - Many camps offer included or optional activities
5. **Reviews** - Always check recent reviews from other travelers

## Booking Tips

- Book directly with camps when possible for better rates
- In high season (March-May and September-November), book at least a month in advance
- Ask about transportation options from the Wadi Rum visitor center
- Confirm what's included in the price (meals, activities, etc.)

Whether you're looking for an authentic desert experience on a budget or a luxurious retreat under the stars, Wadi Rum's diverse camping options ensure you'll find the perfect accommodation for your desert adventure.
