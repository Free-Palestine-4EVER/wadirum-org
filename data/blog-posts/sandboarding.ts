# Sandboarding in Wadi Rum: A Fun Activity for Adventurers

Wadi Rum offers adventure seekers a unique opportunity to experience the thrill of sliding down magnificent sand dunes. Sandboarding has become increasingly popular among visitors looking for an adrenaline rush in this stunning desert landscape.

## What is Sandboarding?

Sandboarding is similar to snowboarding but takes place on sand dunes instead of snowy slopes. Participants stand on a board and slide down sand dunes, experiencing the rush of speed while surrounded by breathtaking desert scenery.

## The Best Dunes for Sandboarding in Wadi Rum

Not all areas in Wadi Rum are suitable for sandboarding. The best locations include:

- **The Red Dune (Al-Haswa Al-Hamra)**: One of the most popular spots, offering a good height and slope for beginners and intermediate sandboarders.
- **Dunes near Um Sabatah**: These dunes provide longer runs and are slightly more challenging.
- **Al Qattar Dunes**: Located in the eastern part of Wadi Rum, these dunes offer varied terrain for different skill levels.

## Equipment and Preparation

Most tour operators in Wadi Rum provide the necessary equipment for sandboarding, which typically includes:

- Sandboards (similar to snowboards but designed specifically for sand)
- Wax (applied to the bottom of the board to reduce friction)
- Safety gear (recommended, especially for beginners)

**Pro tip**: Wear closed shoes and bring a scarf to protect yourself from sand.

## Techniques for Beginners

If you're new to sandboarding, here are some basic techniques to get you started:

1. **Start on smaller dunes**: Build your confidence before attempting larger slopes.
2. **Proper stance**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart with your dominant foot at the back.
3. **Bend your knees**: Keep your center of gravity low for better balance.
4. **Lean back slightly**: This helps prevent the front of the board from digging into the sand.
5. **Use your arms for balance**: Extend them outward like wings when needed.

## Best Time for Sandboarding

The ideal time for sandboarding in Wadi Rum is during the early morning or late afternoon when:
- Temperatures are cooler
- The sand isn't too hot to touch
- The lighting creates dramatic shadows on the dunes, perfect for photography

Avoid midday hours during summer months when temperatures can exceed 40°C (104°F).

## Combining Sandboarding with Other Activities

Most visitors experience sandboarding as part of a broader jeep tour or desert adventure package. Popular combinations include:

- Jeep tour + sandboarding
- Camel ride + sandboarding
- Overnight camping + sunset sandboarding

## Environmental Considerations

When enjoying this exciting activity, remember to respect the desert environment:

- Stay on designated dunes recommended by your guide
- Don't leave any trash behind
- Respect the natural landscape and local Bedouin customs

## Is Sandboarding for Everyone?

While sandboarding is generally accessible to most visitors, it does require:
- Reasonable physical fitness
- Good balance
- The ability to climb up dunes (which can be challenging in soft sand)

Children as young as 8 can participate with proper supervision, making it a great family activity.

## Booking a Sandboarding Experience

Most Wadi Rum tour operators offer sandboarding as part of their packages. Prices typically range from 10-20 JOD ($14-28 USD) when added to an existing tour. Dedicated sandboarding sessions can be arranged with advance notice.

Sandboarding in Wadi Rum offers a perfect blend of adventure and natural beauty. The feeling of sliding down golden dunes with the magnificent desert landscape stretching to the horizon creates memories that last a lifetime. Whether you're an adrenaline junkie or simply looking to try something new, sandboarding should definitely be on your Wadi Rum bucket list.
