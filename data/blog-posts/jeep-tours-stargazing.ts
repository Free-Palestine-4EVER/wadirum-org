    - Sunset viewing from a prime location
    - Traditional Bedouin dinner
    - Professional stargazing session with an astronomy guide
    - Transportation back to your accommodation or overnight stay

    - **Guidance**: Identification of constellations, planets, and celestial objects
    - **Photography**: Tips for night sky photography
    - **Cultural context**: Bedouin stories about the stars and navigation

    ## Best Time for Stargazing

    - **Optimal months**: March-May and September-November
    - **Moon phases**: New moon periods offer the darkest skies

    ## What You Might See

    Depending on the season and conditions:
    - The Milky Way in stunning clarity
    - Meteor showers (during certain periods)
