    # What to Wear on a Wadi Rum Jeep Tour

    Proper clothing for your Wadi Rum Jeep tour ensures comfort and protection in the desert environment. Here's a seasonal guide to what to wear:

    ## Year-Round Essentials

    - **Sun hat**: Wide-brimmed for maximum face and neck protection
    - **Sunglasses**: Polarized to reduce glare from sand
    - **Scarf or buff**: Multi-purpose for sun protection, dust, or warmth
    - **Closed shoes**: Comfortable walking shoes or hiking boots
    - **Day pack**: Small backpack for personal items

    ## Summer (May-September)

    - **Lightweight, loose-fitting clothing**: Natural fabrics like cotton or linen
    - **Long sleeves and pants**: Despite the heat, covering up protects from sun
    - **Light colors**: Reflect rather than absorb heat
    - **Moisture-wicking underlayers**: If you tend to perspire
    - **Swimwear**: Some tours include stops at water sources

    ## Winter (December-February)

    - **Layers**: Temperature varies widely between day and night
    - **Warm jacket**: Desert evenings can drop below 5°C (41°F)
    - **Gloves and beanie**: For early morning or evening tours
    - **Thermal underlayers**: For overnight tours
    - **Waterproof outer layer**: Rare rain can occur in winter

    ## Spring/Fall (March-April, October-November)

    - **Convertible clothing**: Zip-off pants, roll-up sleeves
    - **Medium-weight layers**: For temperature changes
    - **Light jacket or fleece**: For morning and evening

    ## Additional Items

    - **Lip balm and moisturizer**: The desert air is very dry
    - **Sunscreen**: Minimum SPF 30, reapply frequently
    - **Bandana**: To cover nose and mouth during dusty conditions
    - **Camera protection**: Dust-proof bag or cover

    Remember that Jeeps are open-backed, so wind protection is important year-round, and secure any items that might blow away.
