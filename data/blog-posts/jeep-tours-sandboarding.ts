    # Jeep Tours with Sandboarding in Wadi Rum

    Many Wadi Rum Jeep tours now include sandboarding as an exciting activity option, allowing you to slide down the desert's magnificent red sand dunes.

    ## The Sandboarding Experience

    Sandboarding in Wadi Rum typically involves:
    - Transportation by Jeep to the largest dune fields
    - Basic instruction from your guide
    - Equipment provision (usually a simple wooden board)
    - Multiple runs down dunes of varying heights
    - Photography opportunities

    ## Best Locations

    The prime sandboarding spots during Jeep tours include:
    - The Red Sand Dunes near Um Ishrin mountain
    - The larger dunes in the eastern sector
    - The dune field near Lawrence's Spring

    ## Skill Level Required

    No previous experience is necessary. Sandboarding is:
    - Easier to learn than snowboarding
    - Suitable for most ages (typically 8 years and up)
    - Less intimidating than other adventure sports
    - Adjustable to your comfort level (smaller dunes for beginners)

    ## What to Wear

    - Closed shoes (sand can get very hot)
    - Clothing that can get sandy
    - Sunglasses to protect from blowing sand
    - Scarf or buff to cover mouth if windy

    ## Adding to Your Tour

    Most tour operators can include sandboarding for an additional 10-15 JOD per person. The activity typically adds about 30-45 minutes to your tour itinerary.

    For the best experience, schedule your sandboarding in the early morning or late afternoon when temperatures are cooler and the sand is less hot.
