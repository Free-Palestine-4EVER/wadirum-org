    # Top Natural Landmarks to See During Your Jeep Tour

    Wadi Rum is home to spectacular natural landmarks that have been shaped by millions of years of geological processes. Here are the top formations to include in your Jeep tour itinerary:

    ## The Seven Pillars of Wisdom

    Named after T.E. Lawrence's famous book, this massive rock formation features seven distinct pillars and is visible from the Visitor Center. While most tours don't stop here, it's worth asking your guide to include it.

    ## Um Fruth Rock Bridge

    A natural stone arch standing about 15 meters high. Unlike some other bridges, this one is relatively easy to climb for a spectacular photo opportunity.

    ## Burdah Rock Bridge

    One of the highest natural arches in the world at about 35 meters high. Reaching the top requires a moderate hike, but the views are worth it.

    ## Khazali Canyon

    A narrow fissure in the mountain with ancient Thamudic and Nabataean inscriptions dating back thousands of years. The canyon extends about 100 meters into the mountain.

    ## Lawrence's Spring

    A small spring associated with T.E. Lawrence, offering a shady spot and views of ancient inscriptions. The spring itself is often dry, but the site remains historically significant.

    ## The Red Sand Dunes

    Massive dunes with distinctively red sand, perfect for climbing, sandboarding, or simply admiring the contrast against the blue sky.

    ## Mushroom Rock

    A uniquely shaped rock formation that resembles a mushroom, created by differential erosion of the sandstone.

    Make sure your tour includes at least 4-5 of these landmarks for a comprehensive Wadi Rum experience.
