    # Jeep Tours in Wadi Rum with Lunch Included

    Many Wadi Rum Jeep tours include authentic Bedouin meals as part of the experience, adding a cultural dimension to your desert adventure.

    ## Traditional Bedouin Lunch Experience

    Full-day Jeep tours typically include a traditional Bedouin lunch prepared in the desert. This usually features:

    - **Zarb**: Meat and vegetables slow-cooked underground in a sand oven
    - **Mansaf**: Jordan's national dish with lamb, rice, and yogurt sauce
    - **Maqluba**: An upside-down rice and vegetable dish
    - **Fresh salads and bread**: Often baked in the sand
    - **Bedouin tea**: Sweet tea with herbs like sage or mint

    ## Lunch Locations

    Meals are typically served in scenic locations such as:
    - Under the shade of a natural rock formation
    - Inside a Bedouin tent
    - At a desert camp
    - Near a spectacular viewpoint

    ## Dietary Accommodations

    Most tour operators can accommodate dietary restrictions with advance notice, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.

    The lunch break also provides a welcome rest during the heat of the day and an opportunity to connect with your Bedouin guides.
