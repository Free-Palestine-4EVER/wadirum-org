# Wadi Rum Entry Fees: What You Need to Know

Visiting the magnificent Wadi Rum Protected Area requires paying an entrance fee that helps maintain this UNESCO World Heritage Site. This guide covers everything you need to know about Wadi Rum entry fees, including costs, payment methods, and money-saving tips.

## Standard Entry Fees

As of 2024, the standard entry fees for Wadi Rum Protected Area are:

- **Foreign visitors**: 5 JOD (approximately $7 USD) per person
- **Jordanian citizens**: 1 JOD per person
- **Children under 12**: Free (with proof of age)

These fees are collected at the Visitor Center, which serves as the gateway to the protected area.

## What's Included in the Entry Fee

The entry fee includes:

- Access to the Wadi Rum Protected Area
- Basic map of the main sites
- Use of the facilities at the Visitor Center
- Conservation contribution to help preserve the desert ecosystem

The entry fee does **not** include:

- Transportation within the protected area
- Guide services

## Jordan Pass Holders

If you have purchased a Jordan Pass (highly recommended for most tourists visiting Jordan), your Wadi Rum entry fee is **included** in the pass. Simply present your Jordan Pass (digital or printed) at the Visitor Center to gain entry without additional payment.

The Jordan Pass comes in three varieties:

1. **Jordan Wanderer**: 70 JOD ($99 USD) - Includes 1-day visit to Petra
2. **Jordan Explorer**: 75 JOD ($106 USD) - Includes 2-day visit to Petra
3. **Jordan Expert**: 80 JOD ($113 USD) - Includes 3-day visit to Petra

All three options include the Wadi Rum entry fee, making the Jordan Pass an excellent value if you're also visiting Petra and other attractions in Jordan.

## Special Permits and Additional Fees

### Photography Permits

- **Professional photography/filming**: Requires a special permit
- **Cost**: 70 JOD ($99 USD) for professional equipment
- **Application**: Must be arranged in advance through the Visitor Center or a tour operator

*Note: Regular tourist photography with standard cameras and smartphones does not require a special permit.*

### Camping Fees

- **Wild camping**: Not permitted without proper authorization
- **Organized camping**: Included in tour packages or camp bookings

## Payment Methods

- **Currency**: Jordanian Dinar (JOD) is the preferred currency
- **Cash**: Most reliable payment method
- **Credit cards**: Accepted at the Visitor Center but may be subject to technical issues
- **Foreign currency**: USD and EUR may be accepted but at unfavorable exchange rates

*Note: There are no ATMs in Wadi Rum Village or at the Visitor Center. The nearest ATMs are in Aqaba or Petra.*

## Visitor Center Hours

The Wadi Rum Visitor Center, where you pay the entry fee, operates during these hours:

- **Summer (April-October)**: 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM
- **Winter (November-March)**: 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM

It's recommended to arrive early, especially during peak season, to avoid crowds and make the most of your day in the desert.

## Tips for Saving Money on Entry Fees

1. **Purchase the Jordan Pass** if you're visiting multiple attractions in Jordan
2. **Travel with children under 12** as they enter free
3. **Plan a longer stay** to maximize the value of your entry fee
4. **Combine with other southern Jordan attractions** like Petra and Aqaba for efficient travel

Yes, all visitors must pay the entry fee regardless of accommodation arrangements. Some camps include the entry fee in their packages, but it's best to confirm this in advance.
