    # Exploring Wadi Rum's Valleys and Arches by Jeep

    Wadi Rum's landscape is characterized by dramatic valleys (wadis) and natural stone arches that can be best explored by Jeep. Here are the most impressive formations you'll encounter:

    ## Magnificent Valleys

    - **Wadi Um Ishrin**: Known as the "Valley of the Moon" with towering cliffs
    - **Wadi Khazali**: Famous for its ancient Nabataean inscriptions
    - **Wadi Sabet**: Less visited valley with stunning rock formations
    - **Barrah Canyon**: A long, straight valley with impressive walls

    ## Natural Rock Arches

    - **Um Fruth Rock Bridge**: A lower arch that visitors can climb
    - **Burdah Rock Bridge**: One of the highest natural arches in the world
    - **Little Bridge**: A smaller but picturesque arch
    - **Khazali Canyon**: Narrow passage with overhanging rocks

    ## Jeep Access Advantages

    Jeeps can navigate the soft sand and rough terrain to reach these formations, many of which would be difficult or impossible to access on foot. Your Bedouin driver knows exactly how to approach each site for the best views and photo opportunities.

    Most full-day Jeep tours include visits to several valleys and at least one or two of the famous rock arches.
