### Questions to Ask Before Booking

2. Is transportation from the visitor center included?
3. What activities are offered and at what additional cost?
4. Is there heating/cooling for extreme temperatures?
5. How far is the camp from the main tourist sites?

### Hybrid Options
Many camps now offer different accommodation types within the same property. This can be ideal for groups with different preferences or budgets.

No matter which type of accommodation you choose, spending a night in Wadi Rum is an unforgettable experience that connects you with the timeless beauty of the desert and the rich culture of the Bedouin people.
