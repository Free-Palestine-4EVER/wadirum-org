                  Jordan, officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is an Arab country in Western Asia. It is situated
                  at the crossroads of Asia, Africa, and Europe, within the Levant region, on the East Bank of the
                  Jordan River.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Known for its ancient monuments, nature reserves, and seaside resorts, Jordan is home to countless
                  attractions including the world-famous archaeological site of Petra, the Dead Sea, and of course, the
                  stunning desert wilderness of Wadi Rum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jordan is a relatively small country with a population of around 10 million people. The official
                  language is Arabic, though English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas. The currency is the
                  Jordanian Dinar (JOD).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The country enjoys a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool winters. Jordan is known for
                  its hospitality, safety, and rich cultural heritage, making it a popular destination for travelers
                  from around the world.

                  Wadi Rum, also known as the Valley of the Moon, is a protected desert wilderness in southern Jordan.
                  It features dramatic sandstone mountains, natural arches, and narrow gorges, creating one of the most
                  spectacular desert landscapes in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times and has a rich cultural history. It was home to
                  many human civilizations, including the Nabataeans who left their mark with rock inscriptions and
                  temple ruins. More recently, it gained fame as the base of operations for T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of
                  Arabia) during the Arab Revolt of 1917-18.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2011, Wadi Rum was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for both its natural and cultural
                  significance. The protected area covers 720 square kilometers of dramatic desert wilderness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, Wadi Rum is a major tourist destination in Jordan, offering visitors the chance to experience
                  the stunning desert landscape through jeep tours, camel rides, hiking, rock climbing, and overnight
                  stays in Bedouin camps.

          <div className="max-w3xl mx-auto space-y-6 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              When visiting Jordan and Wadi Rum, respecting local customs and traditions will enhance your experience
              and show appreciation for the local culture. Here are some important etiquette tips:
            </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Dress Code</h3>
              <p>
                Jordan is a relatively liberal country by Middle Eastern standards, but modest dress is still
                appreciated, especially in rural areas. For women, shoulders and knees should be covered. For men,
                shorts are acceptable in tourist areas but long pants are preferred elsewhere.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Greetings</h3>
              <p>
                Jordanians are known for their hospitality. A handshake is the common greeting, though some may place
                their hand over their heart instead (especially when greeting someone of the opposite gender). Learning
                a few Arabic phrases like "Marhaba" (hello) and "Shukran" (thank you) is always appreciated.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Photography</h3>
              <p>
                Always ask permission before photographing local people, especially Bedouin women. Some may decline or
                request a small fee. Military installations and airports should not be photographed.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Dining</h3>
              <p>
                If invited to a Bedouin meal, it's customary to eat with your right hand. Leaving a small amount of food
                on your plate indicates you are satisfied; finishing everything might suggest you're still hungry.
                Refusing tea or coffee can be considered impolite, as hospitality is a cornerstone of Bedouin culture.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Ramadan</h3>
              <p>
                If visiting during the holy month of Ramadan, be respectful by not eating, drinking, or smoking in
                public during daylight hours. Most restaurants and cafes will be closed until sunset, though some
                tourist establishments may remain open.

                    <strong>Visa:</strong> Check visa requirements for your nationality. Many visitors can obtain a visa

                    <strong>Jordan Pass:</strong> Consider purchasing a Jordan Pass before arrival, which includes entry
                    to many attractions (including Petra) and waives the tourist visa fee if staying at least 3 nights.

                    <strong>Travel Insurance:</strong> Comprehensive travel insurance is recommended, including coverage

                  <span>
                    <strong>Health:</strong> No special vaccinations are required for Jordan, but it's always good to
                    check with your doctor before traveling.

                    <strong>Currency:</strong> The Jordanian Dinar (JOD) is the local currency. ATMs are available in
                    major cities but not in Wadi Rum, so bring enough cash.
